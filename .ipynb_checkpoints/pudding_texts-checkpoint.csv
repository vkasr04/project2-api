hundreds of Iraqi workmen dig for ancient finds. The caption 
Northern Iraq appears at the bottom of the screen as the digging

	A CRACK OF THUNDER!

	On a distant, rainy hill, the old Frankenstein castle, as
	we knew and loved it, is illuminated by ANOTHER BOLT OF

	castle -- which is only lit by candles.

	Now we are just outside a rain-splattered window of the
	study.  We LOOK IN and SEE:

	An open coffin rests on a table we can not see it's contents.
	As the CAMERA SLOWLY CIRCLES the coffin for a BETTER VIEW...

A BANK OF FOUR COLOR TELEVISION ON MONITORS

It is 7:14 P.M., Monday, September 22, 1975, and we are
watching the network news programs on CBS, NBC, ABC and
UBS-TV, the network of our story.  The AUDIO is OFF;
and head shots of WALTER CRONKITE, JOHN CHANCELLOR,
HOWARD K. SMITH and HARRY REASONER, and of course,
the anchorman of our network, HOWARD BEALE, silently
flit and flicker across the four television screens,
interspersed with the news of the day -- President

		cut-off legs, assorted sport-diving paraphernalia, including

EXT. GALAXY - PLANET HOTH

A Star Destroyer moves through space, releasing Imperial probe robots 
from its underside.  

One of these probes zooms toward the planet Hoth and lands on its ice-
covered surface.  An explosion marks the point of
impact.  

EXT. HOTH - METEORITE CRATER - SNOW PLAIN - DAY

A weird mechanical sound rises above the whining of the wind.  A 
strange probe robot, with several extended sensors, emerges from the

snow plain and disappears into the distance.

EXT. PLAIN OF HOTH - DAY

A small figure gallops across the windswept ice slope.  The bundled

              A piercing high note is sustained on the soundtrack as the
              main title, ""CRYSTAL JAPAN"" speeds straight at the audience
              in 3-D and seems to jump right out at them.
 
              The opening credits follow.  Ominous theme music fills the
              soundtrack, growing darker and more dissonant.
 
              The theme music slowly dissolves into the sound of a radio
              news broadcast, as the credits continue to unfold.

	blooms like plants touched by springtime.  A quick-
	silver surface of color mirrors lush reef growth.


2	SURREALISTIC CREATURES							2

	Swim, creep, crawl, stalk, hide in their endless
	quest to survive.


3	FISH									3

	A beautiful aquarium of peace and tranquility.


4	TERROR									4

	The fish suddenly explode in panic, darting in all
	different directions, swimming instinctively for
	their threatened lives.


5	GROUPER									5

	300 pounds.  Awesome and ugly, swimming away as fast
	as it can go.


6	ANOTHER ANGLE - GROUPER							6

	As we come closer on it.
	Closer.
	It glances back, eyes wide with fear of impending death.
	It reverses course, ATTACKING CAMERA, and the grouper

Prologue
Legend has it, in the mystic land of Prydain. There was once a king so cruel, and so evil, that even the gods feared him. Since no prison could hold him, he was thrown alive into a crucible of moltin iron. There his demonic spirit was captured, in the form of a great black cauldron. For uncounted centuries The Black Cauldron lay hidden, while evil men searched for it. Knowing whoever possessed it, would have the power to resurrect an army of deathless warriors. And with them, rule the world.

CLOSE ON a finely-worked Medieval tapestry.  In the
background, beyond the intricate foliage, stands a moated
castle where a troop of mounted hunters set out for the
chase with dogs and lances.  In the foreground, a lovely
young maiden heads for the forest, carrying an armful of
flowers.  The forest, stylistically rendered by the
weaver's art, has numbers of small animals cunningly
worked into the warp and woof.  A Green Man, clad only in
leaves and vines, hides behind a tree, watching a stately
pair of unicorns grazing on the greensward.

REVISED FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

							PRODUCER, DIRECTOR:
							JOSEPH SARGENT


		     TITLE SEQUENCE:  UNDER WATER - NIGHT

		     As titles and music play, we move
		     slowly beneath the water off the
		     coast of Amity.

		     We swim beneath a dock, threading
		     our way through pilings...

		     We move through the water, swimming,
		     just swimming, with all the time in
		     the world.

		     We move over some junk -- the 
		     rusting front end of an automobile...
		     We're going somewhere...

		     The water becomes shallow and we
		     stop.  Up through the surface, the
		     images distorted, we see the lights
		     of a town...Amity...

		     We move on, swimming again, just
		     swimming, moving through the water
		     until, suddenly, the water swirls
		     with motion around us.  We experience
		     the sensation of turning and then
		     we see it, THE EYE...And, fo"

A half finished barn. A tumbleweed blows by the screen.

A fence. A sharp piece of farm equipment is hanging from 
it.

A Halloween style weathervane.

towering trees.

men in their thirties or forties. They don't talk to each 
other, just stare straight ahead. We"

NARRATOR:     Once upon a time, in a faraway land, a young prince lived in a
              shining castle.  Although he had everything his heart desired,
              the prince was spoiled, selfish, and unkind.  But then, one
              winter's night, an old beggar woman came to the castle and
              offered him a single rose in return for shelter from the bitter
              cold. Repulsed by her haggard appearance, the prince sneered at
              the gift and turned the old woman away, but she warned him not
              to be deceived by appearances, for beauty is found within.

              melted away to reveal a beautiful enchantress.  The prince
              tried to apologize, but it was too late, for she had seen that
              there was no love in his heart, and as punishment, she

INT.  RESTAURANT - MORNING (PRESENT DAY)

LOUISE is a waitress in a coffee shop.  She is in her
early-thirties, but too old to be doing this.  She is very
pretty and meticulously groomed, even at the end of her
shift.  She is slamming dirty coffee cups from the counter
into a bus tray underneath the counter.  It is making a
lot of RACKET, which she is oblivious to.  There is
COUNTRY MUZAK in the b.g., which she hums along with.


INT.  THELMA'S KITCHEN - MORNING

THELMA is a housewife.  It's morning and she is slamming
coffee cups from the breakfast table into the kitchen
sink, which is full of dirty breakfast dishes and some
stuff left from last night's dinner which had to ""soak"".
She is still "

1	TITLES - The sound of a woman walking on a deserted street

2	EXT NIGHT STREET - FADE UP - We see a woman's feet wearing red stiletto
	shoes. It is late at night and she is very alone.

	She turns a bend and enters a darkened street, her heels making a
	distinctive click on the path.

	Suddenly we see a figure in the darkness - the womans pauses for a beat
	before continuing. She approaches the figure who is dressed in a heavy
	motorbike jacket... The figure turns round - it is a girl with bleached
	blonde hair, wearing a low cut, tight white T Shirt. The white seems to
	glow a little.

	Without warning, the WOMAN produces a hammer from her bag and raises it
	above BLONDE...

	Screams....

	FADE TO BLACK - TITLES


3	EXT NIGHT PARK - The young BLONDE lies motionless on the floor, most of
	her clothes ripped from her still body. The sound of digging can be
	heard, then of a knife being unsheathed.

	Her body is dragged out of shot...

	FADE TO BLACK - TITLES

     aka The Professional

     Version 1 Script

     from an original idea by Luc Besson

     Notes:
     The beginning is identical to the movie, so we considered 
     useless reporting it here.  It's from Mathilda's first rifle 
     training scene that the original script is totally different 
     from the movie. This version is much more violent and the 
     affective relation between Leon and Mathilda shows no more 
     ambiguities. In this version, Mathilda was to be aged 13 or 
     14

     ** * * * * * * * * *

     Leon and Mathilda arrive on the roof of a building which 
     faces Central Park. They get close to a wall and maintain this 
     position. Sunlight floods the park.

                               LEON(concentrated)

              I remember before I was born, wounded up like 
              a fur ball in the highly overrated fetal 
              position, luckily I'm not claustrophobic, but 
              on rainy days I still feel a tightness in my 
              left shoulder. So now that my stepmother's 
              pregnant, I understand what the baby's going 
              through, and I'm not jealous at all, really, 
              not at all.

       VIEW OF THE SULTENFUSS' DINING ROOM TABLE. VADA, HARRY AND 
       SHELLY ARE SEATED. SHELLY IS VERY PREGNANT

Color 1ST ANNIVERSARY BANNERS flap along with swirling dust and bending vegetation
as a HELICOPTER touches down on the CHEMCO grounds, within its tall fences, near
its administration building. 

The banner reads

			  This is just the beginning.

CHEMCO EXECUTIVES are eagerly standing by with a handful of uniformed SECURITY
PEOPLE, keeping a respectful distance.

A MALE SPOKESPERSON, well groomed and David Duke-plastic-surgery handsome, talks
into a wireless mike, ADDRESSING THE CAMERA as his THREE-MAN CREW tapes.  He walks
toward the front entrance--

Fourth Draft
October 18, 1995
EXT ROAD - DAY

An old foreign CAR on its last legs winds its way down a sunny road deep in the Irish countryside -

ROLL CREDITS 

EXT CAR - DAY

Two older CHAR WOMEN are in the car, searching apprehensively for their destination - 

EXT ROAD - DAY

The car turns down a forbidding road - we follow the car as it makes its way down the winding,
wooded path - 

EXT GLEN ABBEY MANOR - DAY

The Victorian manor looms on the horizon in the hazy afternoon light - 

The car approaches and stops in front of the house - 

END CREDITS

The two women get out, surveying the dark building - the FIRST CHAR WOMAN opens the trunk,
removing a CARRYING TRAY of cleaning supplies -

              Langley, Illinois.  A quiet suburb located fifty miles
              outside of Chicago.
 
              SUPER the legend:  ""Langley, Illinois.  October 28th 1998""
 
              A HOUSE
 
              nestled in the middle of a tree-lined street.  A Honda Civic
              pulls into a darkened driveway, the headlights are
              extinguished...
 
              PAMELA WHITTINGTON, a middle-aged woman in full registered
              nurse attire, emerges from the parked car.
 
              An unlit cigarette dangles loosely from her lips.  She heads
              to the porch, digging through her purse in search of a
              light...
 
              CRUNCH!
 
              Pamela stops in her tracks, looks down at her feet to discover
 
              GLASS
 
              scattered across the porch.  She looks at the porch light
              hanging above her head.

            FADE IN ON:

            Black screen

            SOUND OS -- a CHOKED BACK BREATH, GASPING, lungs looking for

            INT. LIMBO/WATER - ANOTHER TIME

            GASPING for BREATH continues, more relentless, harder,
            heavier and into the FRAME we SEE fragments, slowed into
            special motion, dreamlike, surreal:

            Dirty blonde hair lifts and tumbles; 

            Bubbles POP through the murky water; 

            A hand and then its attached arm swims, in trouble, trying to
            climb;

            And then floats as if disembodied, momentary;

            The SWIMMER drifts, then a brief effort twisting, signs of
            struggle;

            A leg pushes off the nothingness, threatened, an impossible
            fight;

            We won't see his face until he reaches the next pool of
            light, but he walks with shoulders hunched in fear.

            Moving down the block, all shops abandoned.  Broken windows.

NSEA PROTECTOR.  Magnificent, though on closer inspection it

SETH DAVIS stares out the window.

Seth is 20 years old.  No menacing physical presence but a

Confident but edgy.  Eyes always darting.

The bus is filled with 19 and 20 year olds.  They wear very
sharp suits: Hugo Boss, Armani, very slick.

They're going nuts.  Cards games in the aisle.  Five guys
throwing dice in the back.  Booze and coke, yelling,

Burkittsville, Maryland while shooting a documentary called ""The Blair Witch

A year later their footage was found.


Man off camera: You look a little blurry.  Let me zoom out okay?

Heather:  Okay.  Huh.

Man:  Okay got you.

Heather:  This is my home.  Which I am leaving the comforts of, for the 
weekend.  To explore the Blair Witch.

never know what's going to happen.

Heather: And this is a very important book, because it has the article about 
what happened at Coffin Rock.

Man:  That's pretty old.

Heather:  Yeah it's totally old.

INT. CAR DRIVING DOWN COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

KIRSTY GOODING looks out the passenger window as the trees go
whizzing past. She's attractive, late twenties, warmly
sophisticated. Something makes her smile. She turns to the
driver and thinks real hard as she says this.

                    KIRSTY
          Okay. Cubic root of nine thousand two
          hundred and sixty one.

TREVOR is her husband, late twenties as well. God gave him
brains and beauty. He has used them both prodigiously.

                    TREVOR
          Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now
          Kirsty?

                    KIRSTY
          Shut up and play darling. Your turn.

                    TREVOR
          Five hundred ninety two thousand seven
          hundred and four.

                                 Based on the 1955 movie

                                    ""The Ladykillers""

                                     by William Rose

                

               EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - DAY

               A BOAT

               Specifically, a garbage scow.

               We see it from ON HIGH, chugging down the placid but mighty 
               Mississippi.

               Head credits play over COVERAGE of the garbage scow. No sound, 
               except for an incongruously heroic score.

               The COVERAGE is a little rough, coarse-grained; along with 
               the overbearing score it almost suggests an industrial film 
               rather than a feature.

               One piece of sound -- the toot of the boat's horn -- is 
               obviously library. And not a new library either.
