      "Wardell Stephen Curry II (/ˈstɛfən/ STEF-ən;[1] born March 14, 1988)[2] is an American professional basketball player and point guard for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Widely regarded as the greatest shooter, and one of the greatest players of all time, Curry is credited with revolutionizing the sport by inspiring teams and players to take more three-point shots.[3][4][5][6] He is a four-time NBA champion, a two-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), an NBA Finals MVP, an NBA All-Star Game MVP, an NBA Clutch Player of the Year, and the inaugural NBA Western Conference Finals MVP. He is also a two-time NBA scoring champion, a ten-time NBA All-Star, and a ten-time All-NBA selection (including four on the First Team). Internationally, he has won two gold medals at the FIBA World Cup and a gold medal at the 2024 Summer Olympics as part of the U.S. men's national team.\n",
      "Curry is the son of former NBA player Dell Curry and the older brother of current NBA player Seth Curry. He played collegiately for the Davidson Wildcats, where he set career scoring records for Davidson and the Southern Conference, and helped the Wildcats advance to the Elite Eight in 2008. He was named Conference Player of the Year twice, and set the NCAA single-season record for three-pointers made (162) during his sophomore year. Curry was selected by the Warriors as the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft.\n",
      "In 2014–15, Curry won his first league MVP award and led the Warriors to their first championship since 1975. The following season, he became the first player to be elected MVP by a unanimous vote and lead the league in scoring while shooting above 50–40–90. That same year, the Warriors broke the record for the most wins in a regular season in NBA history (73) en route to the 2016 NBA Finals, which they lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 7. Curry helped the Warriors win back-to-back titles in 2017 and 2018, and reach the 2019 NBA Finals, losing to the Toronto Raptors in six games. Following injury struggles and missed playoff appearances in 2020 and 2021, Curry won his fourth championship with the Warriors and first Finals MVP award, defeating the Boston Celtics in the 2022 NBA Finals. The same season, he became the all-time leader in three-pointers made in NBA history, surpassing Ray Allen.[7]\n",
      "Curry is the holder of numerous other records, notably for his efficiency and three-point shooting. He has the highest career free-throw percentage in NBA history (91.0%) and has led the league in three-pointers made a record eight times. In 2013, he set the NBA record for three-pointers made in a regular season with 272, surpassed that record in 2015 (286), and again in 2016 (402).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Early life\n",
      "Curry is the son of Sonya and Dell Curry. He was born in Akron, Ohio, at Summa Akron City Hospital, while his father was a member of the Cleveland Cavaliers.[8][9] He grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina, where his father spent most of his NBA career with the Charlotte Hornets.[10] Dell often took Curry and his younger brother Seth to his games, where they would shoot with the Hornets during warm-ups.[11] The family briefly moved to Toronto, where Dell finished out his career as a member of the Raptors.[10] During this time, Curry played for the Queensway Christian College boys' basketball team, leading them to an undefeated season.[12][13] He was also a member of Toronto 5–0, a club team that plays across Ontario,[14][15] pitting him against fellow future NBA players Cory Joseph and Kelly Olynyk.[15] Curry led the team to a 33–4 record, en route to winning the provincial championship.[16]\n",
      "After Dell's retirement, the family moved back to Charlotte and Curry enrolled at Charlotte Christian School,[17] where he was named all-conference and all-state, and led his team to three conference titles and three state playoff appearances. Because of his father's storied career at Virginia Tech, Curry wanted to play college basketball for the Hokies, but was only offered a walk-on spot due in part to his slender 160-pound frame.[18] He ultimately chose to attend Davidson College, who had aggressively recruited him from the tenth grade.[19]\n",
      "\n",
      "College career\n",
      "Freshman season\n",
      "Before Curry even played in his first game for the Wildcats, head coach Bob McKillop praised him at a Davidson alumni event, saying: \"Wait 'til you see Steph Curry. He is something special.\"[20] In his first collegiate game against Eastern Michigan, Curry finished with 15 points but committed 13 turnovers. In the next game against Michigan, he scored 32 points, dished out four assists, and grabbed nine rebounds. Curry finished the season leading the Southern Conference in scoring with 21.5 points per game. He was second in the nation among freshmen in scoring, behind only Kevin Durant of Texas. Curry's scoring helped the Wildcats to a 29–5 overall record and a Southern Conference regular-season title. On March 2, 2007, in the Southern Conference tournament semi-finals against Furman, Curry made his 113th three-point field goal of the year, breaking Keydren Clark's NCAA freshman season record for three-pointers.[21]\n",
      "Curry eclipsed the school freshman scoring record with his 502nd point against Chattanooga on February 6, 2007.[22] On March 15, 2007, Davidson marched into the NCAA tournament as a 13th seed set to play Maryland; despite Curry's game-high 30 points, Davidson lost 82–70.[23] At the end of his freshman season, Curry was named Southern Conference Freshman of the Year, SoCon Tournament MVP, and selected to the SoCon All-tournament team, All-freshman team, and All-SoCon First Team.[24] He was also an honorable mention in Sports Illustrated's All-Mid-Major. After the season ended, he was selected for the USA team to appear at the 2007 FIBA U-19 World Championships in which he averaged 9.4 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 2.2 assists in 19.4 minutes, helping Team USA to a silver medal finish.[25]\n",
      "\n",
      "Sophomore season\n",
      "Curry at the 2008 NCAA tournament\n",
      "In his sophomore season in 2007–08, Curry had grown to his adult height of 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) and again led the Southern Conference in scoring, averaging 25.5 points per game while adding 4.7 rebounds per game and 2.8 assists per game. He led the Wildcats to a 26–6 regular-season record and a 20–0 conference record. As a result of Curry's exceptional play, Davidson earned its third straight NCAA tournament bid.\n",
      "On March 21, 2008, Davidson matched up with seventh-seeded Gonzaga. Gonzaga led by 11 points early in the second half but Curry went on to score 30 points in the half[26] to push Davidson to their first NCAA Tournament win since 1969 with a score of 82–76. Curry ended the game with 40 points while also going 8-for-10 from three-point range.[27] On March 23, Davidson played second-seeded Georgetown in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. Georgetown was ranked eighth nationally and entered the game as a heavy favorite after an appearance in the Final Four in 2007. Curry managed just five points in the first half of the game as Davidson trailed by as many as 17 points, but his 25 second-half points led Davidson to a 74–70 comeback victory.[26]\n",
      "On March 28, 2008, Curry led Davidson to another win, against third-seeded Wisconsin. Curry scored 33 points as Davidson won 73–56 to advance to the Elite 8.[28] Curry joined Clyde Lovellette, Jerry Chambers, and Glenn Robinson as the only college players to score over 30 points in their first four career NCAA tournament games.[28] Curry also tied Darrin Fitzgerald of Butler for the single-season record for most three-pointers with 158.[29][30] On March 30, 2008, he set the record, against the top-seeded Kansas Jayhawks, with his 159th three-pointer of the season. Curry scored 25 points in the game but Davidson lost 59–57, and the Jayhawks went on to win the championship.[31]\n",
      "Curry finished the season averaging 25.9 points, 2.9 assists, and 2.1 steals per game. He was named to the Associated Press' All-America Second Team on March 31, 2008.[32] He also was named the Most Outstanding Player of the Midwest Region of the 2008 NCAA tournament, becoming the first player from a team not making the Final Four to do so since Juwan Howard of Michigan in 1994.[33] Curry was nominated for an ESPY in the Breakthrough Player of the Year category.[34]\n",
      "\n",
      "Junior season\n",
      "After Davidson's loss against Kansas in the NCAA Regional Finals, Curry announced that he would return for his junior year.[29] He stated that he wanted to develop as a point guard, his likely position in the NBA. On November 18, 2008, Curry scored a career-high 44 points in Davidson's 82–78 loss to Oklahoma.[35] He extended a career-long streak by scoring at least 25 points for the seventh straight game.[35] On November 21, Curry registered a career-high 13 assists, to go along with 30 points in Davidson's 97–70 win over Winthrop.[36] On November 25, against Loyola, Curry was held scoreless as Loyola constantly double-teamed him. It was Curry's only scoreless collegiate game and just his second without double-digit points. He finished 0-for-3 from the field as Davidson won the game 78–48.[37] In Davidson's next game 11 days later, Curry matched his career high of 44 in a 72–67 win over North Carolina State.[38]\n",
      "Curry surpassed the 2000-point mark for his career on January 3, 2009, as he scored 21 points against Samford.[39] On February 14, 2009, Curry rolled his ankle in the second half of a win over Furman. The injury caused Curry to miss the February 18 game against The Citadel, the first and only game he missed in his college career.[40] On February 28, 2009, Curry became Davidson's all-time leading scorer with 34 points in a 99–56 win against Georgia Southern. That gave Curry 2,488 points for his career, surpassing previous school leader John Gerdy.[41] Davidson won the 2008–09 Southern Conference regular season championship for the south division, finishing 18–2 in the conference.[42][43]\n",
      "In the 2009 Southern Conference tournament, Davidson played Appalachian State in the quarterfinals and won 84–68. Curry scored 43 points, which is the third most points in Southern Conference tournament history.[44] In the semifinals, against the College of Charleston, Curry had 20 points but Davidson lost 52–59. Despite lobbying from Davidson head coach Bob McKillop and Charleston coach Bobby Cremins,[45] the Wildcats failed to get an NCAA tournament bid. Instead, they received the sixth seed in the 2009 NIT. Davidson played the third seed, South Carolina, on the road in the first round. Curry scored 32 points as the Wildcats beat the Gamecocks 70–63.[46][47] Davidson then lost 80–68 to the Saint Mary's Gaels in the second round. Curry registered 26 points, nine rebounds, and five assists in what was his final game for the Wildcats.[48]\n",
      "In his final season at Davidson, Curry averaged 28.6 points, 5.6 assists, and 2.5 steals. He was the NCAA scoring leader and was named a consensus first team All-American.[49] Curry opted out of his senior year at Davidson, but he stated that he still planned to earn his degree.[50] He completed his bachelor's degree in sociology in May 2022.[51] Curry's completion of his degree qualified him for jersey or number retirement; Davidson reserves that honor for players who complete their degrees at the school. In a ceremony held on August 31, 2022, Curry became the first Davidson player to have his number retired (six others have jerseys retired, but their numbers remain in circulation). At the ceremony, he also entered Davidson's athletic hall of fame and physically received his Davidson diploma.[52][53]\n",

      "On June 25, 2009, his father's 45th birthday, Curry was selected as the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors.[54] Although the Warriors already had another lean, 6-foot-3, offensive-minded guard in Monta Ellis, coach Don Nelson had a penchant for using small lineups in his Nellie Ball system, and had warmed to the idea of selecting Curry.[55][56] However, Ellis announced at a media session that he and Curry were too small to play together.[57] Curry appeared in 80 games (77 starts) during the 2009–10 season, averaging 17.5 points, 4.5 rebounds, 5.9 assists, and 1.90 steals in 36.2 minutes.[58] His second half of the season vaulted him into the rookie of the year race.[59] He was named Western Conference Rookie of the Month for January, March, and April, finishing as the only Western Conference rookie to win the award three times.[58] He finished runner-up for the NBA Rookie of the Year Award behind Tyreke Evans[59] and was a unanimous NBA All-Rookie First Team selection, becoming the first Warriors player since Jason Richardson in 2001–02 to earn All-Rookie First Team honors.[58] He scored 30-plus points eight times, setting the most 30-point games by any rookie in 2009–10 and the most since LeBron James had 13 and Carmelo Anthony had 10 in 2003–04. Curry had five 30-point/10-assist games, which tied Michael Jordan for the second-most 30-point/10-assist games by a rookie (Oscar Robertson is first with 25). He became just the sixth rookie in NBA history to post a 35-point, 10-assist, 10-rebound game when he registered his first career triple-double with 36 points, 13 assists, and 10 rebounds against the Los Angeles Clippers on February 10. In the Warriors' season finale against the Portland Trail Blazers on April 14, Curry recorded a then- career-high 42 points, nine rebounds and eight assists, becoming the first rookie since Robertson in February 1961 to register at least those numbers in each category in the same game. Curry finished his rookie season with 166 three-pointers, which were, at the time, the most ever by a rookie in NBA history.[58]\n",
      "\n",
      "Curry in March 2011\n",
      "In 2010–11, Curry appeared in 74 games (all starts), averaging 18.6 points, 3.9 rebounds, 5.8 assists, and 1.47 steals in 33.6 minutes per contest.[58] His free throw percentage of .934 (212–227 FT) set a new Warriors single-season record, surpassing the previous mark of .924 set by Rick Barry in 1977–78. He also became the first Warriors player to lead the NBA in free throw percentage since Mark Price in 1996–97.[58] Curry registered 20-or-more points 35 times, including seven 30-plus performances. He posted a season-high 39 points and a then- career-high 14 made field goals (on 20 attempts) against the Oklahoma City Thunder on December 5. In February 2011, during All-Star Weekend, Curry won the Skills Challenge[60] and registered 13 points, eight assists, and six rebounds in 28 minutes as a member of the Sophomore squad in the Rookie Challenge.[58] In May 2011, he was named the recipient of the NBA Sportsmanship Award,[61] and underwent surgery on his right ankle.[62]\n",
      "In the lockout-shortened 2011–12 season, Curry appeared in 26 games (23 starts), averaging 14.7 points, 3.4 rebounds, 5.3 assists, and 1.50 steals in 28.2 minutes per contest. He missed 40 games due to right ankle and foot injuries,[58] including the last 28 games with a sprained right ankle and subsequent surgery on the ankle, which was performed on April 25.[63] In 2012, Golden State included Curry in a trade offer to the Milwaukee Bucks for Andrew Bogut, which the Bucks rejected due to Curry's history with bad ankles. Ellis was traded instead.[64][65][66] According to then- Warriors general manager Larry Riley, they offered Curry with the intention of steering the deal to Ellis.[65] The deal opened an opportunity for Curry to lead the team.[57]\n",

      "Curry earned Western Conference Player of the Month honors for the month of April. During this time he averaged 25.4 points, 8.1 assists, 3.9 rebounds, and 2.13 steals in eight games in the final month of the season to become the third Warrior to win the award, joining Chris Mullin (November 1990 and January 1989) and Bernard King (January 1981). He tallied two of the NBA's top six scoring games with 54 points on February 27 at New York and 47 on April 12 at Los Angeles, becoming the first Warrior to score 45-plus at New York and Los Angeles in the same season since Rick Barry in 1966, joining Barry, Guy Rodgers, and Wilt Chamberlain as the only four Warriors to do so. Curry's 54 points against the Knicks included a then- career-best and then- franchise-record 11 three-pointers, becoming the first player in NBA history to score 50-plus points while hitting 10-plus three-pointers in a game. It was the most scored by a Warrior since Purvis Short tallied 59 points in 1984. In 2013, he appeared in the playoffs for the first time in his career, with the Warriors earning the sixth seed in the Western Conference. In 12 playoff games (all starts), he averaged 23.4 points, 8.1 assists, and 3.8 rebounds. He set a new franchise record with 42 playoff three-pointers, eclipsing the Warriors' career playoff mark of 29 previously held by Jason Richardson, giving him a total of 314 three-pointers for the season to become the first player in NBA history to make at least 300 three-pointers in a single season.[58]\n",

He led the league in three-pointers made for a second consecutive season with 261, becoming the first player since Ray Allen in 2001–02 and 2002–03 to lead the league in three-pointers in back-to-back seasons. He was named Western Conference Player of the Month for April and earned All-NBA Second Team honors, becoming the first Warriors player named to the First or Second Team since 1993–94.[58] On December 7 against the Memphis Grizzlies, Curry eclipsed Jason Richardson (700) as the franchise's leader in career three-pointers.[71] In February, he made his first All-Star appearance,[72] becoming the Warriors' first All-Star starter since Latrell Sprewell in 1995.[58] He scored a season-high 47 points on April 13 against the Portland Trail Blazers for his third 40-point game of the year. He finished the regular season tied for second in the NBA in triple-doubles with four, the most by a Warrior in a single season since Chamberlain had five in 1963–64.[58] Seeded sixth for the second consecutive postseason, the Warriors were defeated in seven games by the Los Angeles Clippers.[73]\n",

      "Curry made his Olympic debut with the 2024 U.S. Olympic team in Paris, alongside his longtime head coach Steve Kerr.[273] He initially struggled from the field. In a tightly contested semifinal game against Serbia, Curry led a 17-point comeback in a 95–91 win, finishing with a tournament-high 36 points, 8 rebounds, and 9-of-14 shooting from three-point range.[274] In the final two minutes, Curry made a successful steal, layup, and two clutch free throws to maintain a lead of four points.[275] He set a national record for most points scored in an Olympic knockout game and an Olympic record for most three-pointers made in a knockout game, respectively.[276][277] His 36 points are the second-most ever scored in a game by an American, behind Carmelo Anthony's 37-point performance against Nigeria in 2012.

      "Listed at 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) and 185 pounds (86 kg), Curry plays almost exclusively at the point guard position combined with the signature play style of an elite shooting guard. He has career averages of 24.8 points, 6.4 assists, 4.7 rebounds, and 1.5 steals per game (through the end of the 2023–24 season),[81] and is the Warriors' all-time points, assists, steals, field goals, three-point field goals, and free-throw percentage leader in both the regular season and the playoffs.[284] His career free throw percentage of 91.0% is the highest in NBA history, and he has led the league in annual free-throw percentage four times.[285][286] He has been named league MVP twice, including the first unanimous selection in league history (2015–16).[81]\n",
      "Lauded for his prolific three-point shooting, athleticism, and versatile playmaking, Curry is a potent offensive threat from underneath the rim to near half-court.[287][288] Using an unorthodox jump shot, he is capable of releasing the ball in under half a second upon jumping, adding greater arc to his shots and making them difficult to block.[289] Therefore, Curry is able to adjust his release and balance to make shots from virtually anywhere on the court. For his high shooting proficiency and ball-handling, he has been referred to as the \"Baby-Faced Assassin\" since his collegiate basketball years[290] and \"Chef Curry\" while playing in the NBA.[291] For their shooting abilities, Curry and former teammate Klay Thompson are often referred to as the Splash Brothers. In the 2013–14 season, they set the record for combined three-pointers made in a season with 484, a record they broke the following season (525), and again in the 2015–16 season (678).[292] Curry is also known for putting pressure on defenses with his long range and led the league in field goals made from beyond 28 feet in the 2015–16 season.[293] A clutch scorer, he often shoots at his best in high-pressure moments and takes game-winning shots.[294][295] Curry has made 10 game-winning shots[c] in his career, the most by any player since the 2012–13 season.[297] He was named the 2023–24 NBA Clutch Player of the Year after leading the league in clutch points, made clutch field goals, and made clutch three-pointers.[296]\n",
      "Curry is also a notably efficient scorer with a career effective field goal percentage (eFG%) of .582 and true shooting percentage (TS%) of .626%, ranking as the 15th and 5th highest in NBA history, respectively. His career three-point field goal percentage (3P%) of .425% ranks as the 12th highest in NBA history, while attempting over nine three-pointers per game (the most all time).[298] In 2015–16, Curry posted the highest eFG% (.630) and 3P% (.454) ever recorded in a season while averaging over 30 points per game.[299] He holds four of the top-five seasons with most three-pointers made, led by his NBA record 402 three-pointers from the 2015–16 season, and has served as the annual leader a record eight times.[300][301] He is also the fastest player in league history to make 2,000 career three-pointers, doing so in 227 fewer games than the previous record-holder, Ray Allen.[144] Additionally, Curry is the fastest player to make 100 three-pointers in a season, doing so in just 19 games, breaking his own previous record of 20 games.[302]\n",
      "Owing to his offensive presence, Curry's scoring creates a \"gravity\" effect that forces opposing defenders to frequently double-team him during both on-ball and off-ball movement, creating mismatches that his teammates exploit.[303][304] With Curry, the Warriors average 10.8 isolations per game; without Curry, they average 15.3 isolations per game. His absence slows the Warriors offense and leads to less passing and ball movement. With Curry, the Warriors average 1.05 points every shot that comes after an off-ball screen; without Curry, it drops to 0.95 points per game. His absence makes it much easier for defenders to switch on screens. Of Curry's success with or without other elite teammates, NBC Sports' Tom Haberstroh said, \"You can pluck All-Star after All-Star off the court like flower petals, and the Steph-led Warriors will still dominate like a champion. He's that transcendent of a player.\"[305]\n",
      "Curry's short stature relative to the rest of the league impeded his defensive abilities for the majority of his career.[306][307] With a low center of gravity, he leverages his fast pace and reflexes to break defenses.[307] Some analysts, including Ethan Sherwood Strauss of ESPN, have complimented his defensive play or called it underrated.[306][308] Strauss said in 2015 that Curry became \"one of the NBA's most effective defenders – ranking fifth among point guards in defensive real plus-minus.\"[308] Curry led the league in total steals in the 2014–15 season and steals per game in the following season.[309]\n",

      "Curry in February 2022\n",
      "Curry is widely considered the greatest shooter and one of the greatest players in NBA history.[3][310][311][312] He is credited with revolutionizing the game of basketball by inspiring teams, from high school to the NBA, to regularly use the three-point shot.[4][5][6] Analysts have referred to him as \"the Michael Jordan of the three-point era\", saying that he did for the three-point shot what Jordan did for the slam dunk.[313][314][315] The Guardian's Robert O'Connell cites Curry's February 27, 2013, game against the New York Knicks, in which he made 11-of-13 shots from behind the arc en route to a 54-point performance, as the start of the three-point era.[316] The era has been referred to as \"the Steph Effect\"[6] or \"the NBA's Three-Point Revolution\".[317] Curry is also often compared to Magic Johnson in debates over the greatest point guard of all time, owing to their generational impact, winningness, and diverse skillsets.[318][319][320]\n",
      "Regarded as the face of the Warriors dynasty,[321][322] Curry helped redefine three-point scoring as a central element of modern-day basketball strategy rather than a mere novelty.[311][323] His influence has inspired the league to transition from physical play around the basket to a \"pace and space\" approach that emphasizes three-point shooting.[323] This transformation can be attributed, in part, to teams attempting to counter the Warriors' dominance and young players aspiring to emulate Curry's extraordinary range.[6][316] Curry regularly attempts shots from 30 to 35 feet at an efficiency of .54, compared to the league average of under .22 from this range and .35 for made three-pointers overall.[311] Kirk Goldsberry of ESPN opined that \"Curry isn't just the best 3-point shooter ever, he's the best deep 3-point shooter ever.\"[311] As Curry himself noted, \"I'm sure coaches tell their high school players that shooting the way I do takes work and time;\" Jesse Dougherty of The Washington Post stated that \"coaches have to explain that while Curry's skill set is something to aspire to, his game is built on fundamentals.\"[6] His ability to make these shots is complemented by a high degree of ball-handling skills, release, and capacity to shoot effectively with one or more defenders contesting his attempts.[311] Sally Jenkins, also of The Washington Post, highlighted the degree of difficulty of Curry's shooting, citing a period in which he achieved a .67 success rate on shots taken from 28 to 50 feet.[288] Jeff Austin of Octagon noted that Curry \"had to develop tremendous strength in his wrists to shoot and maintain that form from 40 and 50 feet.\"[288] Goldsberry concludes that \"no player in the history of the NBA has combined range, volume, and efficiency from downtown as well as Curry,\" making him \"the most efficient volume scorer on the planet.\"[311] The developers of the NBA 2K video game series have even expressed concerns about accurately replicating Curry's unique abilities.[323]\n",
      "Where Curry ranks as one of the greatest NBA players has been more subject to debate.[324] Steve Nash, a two-time NBA MVP and one of the league's all-time efficient shooters, said Curry is \"already an all-time great\" and that people question his greatness \"because he doesn't dominate the game physically. He dances. He pays a tax for that. He pays a tax for his great teammates.\"[324] Scottie Pippen, a six-time NBA champion with the Chicago Bulls, said that Curry's \"willingness to sacrifice\" for Durant is \"one of the great stories in history.\" Crediting Curry as \"one of the greatest guards the game has ever seen\", he said: \"If you have a mind for the game, you know that it takes sacrifice to be great. All the greats have to sacrifice something. Otherwise you can't win.\"[324] In 2018, CBS Sports ranked Curry at No. 19 in their list of \"50 greatest NBA players of all time\".[325] In a 2019 feature, Sports Illustrated stated that \"Curry and the Warriors are a great match of player and system\" and that \"the entire ecosystem is predicated on the idea that a player doesn't need to dominate the ball to dominate a game. Curry took that noble idea and elevated it beyond any reasonable expectation.\"[326] In 2020, ESPN ranked Curry as the 13th greatest basketball player of all time, the second-highest active player behind LeBron James. Nick Friedell of ESPN described Curry as \"the greatest shooter of all time\", noting his game-changing influence \"is seen on every level of basketball as younger generations shoot more than ever while trying to replicate his game.\"[327] In October 2021, Curry was honored as one of the league's greatest players of all time as a member of the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[328] In an \"NBA 75\" feature, Marcus Thompson II of The Athletic opined that \"in 20 years, Curry will be talked about with excitement reserved for the most legendary. Like the elders of today talk about Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Russell, and how their children revere Larry Bird and Charles Barkley.\"[329] After winning his fourth NBA championship and first Finals MVP award in 2022, Complex ranked Curry as the 10th greatest player in NBA history the following year. Angel Diaz cited his generational impact with \"nothing left (for Curry) to accomplish\" as reasons for his place among the sport's greats.[330]\n",

He shot a hole-in-one during the second round and won the tournament on the final hole with a walk-off eagle putt.[358]\n",
      "In August 2019, Curry and Howard University, a historically black institution in Washington, D.C., jointly announced that the school would add NCAA Division I teams in men's and women's golf starting in the 2020–21 school year, with Curry guaranteeing full funding of both teams for six years.[359] Curry is also a fan of English soccer club Chelsea F.C.[360][361]\n",

      "\"No NBA athlete has a larger contingent of fans at every arena, lining up 20- and 30-deep hoping for a glimpse, if not an autograph. This crazy popularity is why his jersey sales consistently rank No. 1, why he was voted to be the captain of the [2018] Western Conference All-Star team and why 9-year-old girls feel comfortable enough to write letters asking for his help – and actually get it.\"\n",

      "—Monte Poole of NBC Sports on Curry's popularity[362]\n",
      "\n",
      "Curry is one of the most successful players in the NBA, and has also become an international celebrity, on par with four-time MVP LeBron James.[363][364] Like James, he has been considered the face of the NBA, but has said that he is not motivated by that and is not looking \"to take LeBron's throne or whatever. You know, I'm trying to chase rings, and that's all I'm about. So that's where the conversation stops for me.\"[365] His flashy play and penchant for coming up big in the clutch have made him a fan favorite, and his smaller physique is said to have made his success seem more attainable for younger fans of the NBA.[366][367] Memorabilia associated with Curry is highly sought after; his 2009 rookie card ranks among the most expensive sports cards of all-time and is the most expensive basketball card ever sold, purchased by Alt Fund II for a record $5.9 million in July 2021.[368][369] Curry has led the NBA in jersey sales for five cumulative years; three consecutive times from the 2015–16 to 2017–18 seasons and two consecutive times from the 2022–23 to 2023–24 seasons, respectively.[370][371]\n",
      "ESPN has ranked Curry among the most famous international athletes. He is the highest paid NBA player of all-time by season and has been ranked in Forbes' list of the world's highest-paid celebrities for his endorsements six times.[372][373] ESPN's Kirk Goldsberry reasoned that one reason for Curry's popularity is that while most people are not tall enough to dunk, everyone can attempt a shot, which is something Curry inspires.[311] Owen Davis of Sky Sports echoed this sentiment, stating: \"After all, not everyone is blessed with supreme height and athleticism, but everyone can learn to pass, dribble and shoot. Curry is proof that if you work hard enough, you can still find ways to dominate, no matter your size.\"[323]\n",
      "Monte Poole of NBC Sports found Curry to be \"the most human of superstars,\" with a childlike aura to him when he plays with success. His fanbase ranges from very young children to the elderly, and casual or committed fans enjoy his style of play. Poole stated that \"the joy factor exponentially increases\" when Curry is on the court and that \"the sight of this relatively ordinary specimen sending much bigger players into silent surrender is an intoxicant for the Warriors and their fans.\"[362]\n",

      "In September 2017, it was announced that Curry had signed an exclusive autograph contract with Steiner Sports Memorabilia. The full product line included hand-signed official basketballs and jerseys, autographed photographs, framed signs and wall-art, game-used memorabilia, and limited-edition pieces.[378]\n",

      "In 2021, Curry, among other high-profile athletes and celebrities, was a paid spokesperson for FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange. In November 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy, erasing billions of dollars in customer funds, with Curry, alongside other spokespeople, being sued for promoting unregistered securities through a class-action lawsuit.[382][383][384] In February 2022, the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a lawsuit against Bitconnect that the Securities Act of 1933 extends to targeted solicitation using social media.[385]\n",

      "In 2012, Curry started donating three insecticide-treated mosquito nets for every three-pointer he made to the United Nations Foundation's Nothing But Nets campaign to combat malaria. He was first introduced to the malaria cause by Davidson teammate Bryant Barr when they were both in school. Curry visited the White House in 2015 and delivered a five-minute speech to dignitaries as part of President Barack Obama's launch of his President's Malaria Initiative strategy for 2015–2020.[387][388]\n",
      "In 2015, Curry wore sneakers that bore the name \"Deah Shaddy Barakat\"—a victim of the 2015 Chapel Hill shooting. According to his sister Suzanne, Deah was known for his \"love for basketball and anything Steph Curry.\"[389] Deah donned Curry's No. 30 as his jersey number for his intramural basketball team at North Carolina State University, and recreated Curry's pose from his GQ photoshoot.[389] Curry said that Deah's family \"did a great job of reaching out to me and making me aware of the details of his life and personality ... It was really kind of a cool deal to be able to use the platform yesterday to honor Deah and his family ... I'm going to send them the shoes I wore yesterday. And hopefully, they know that I've been thinking about them.\"[390][391][392] Following his MVP award win and historic 2015–16 season, Curry donated his prize vehicle—a 2016 Kia Sorento—to the East Oakland Youth Development Center, a local non-profit organization located in the backyard of Oracle Arena.[393]\n",
      "In December 2018, while on a podcast, Curry jokingly questioned whether the Apollo program's Moon landing actually took place, which received substantial media attention and criticism. NASA went on to offer Curry a tour of the Johnson Space Center and discuss further. He partnered with Under Armour in creating signature shoes inspired by the comment and subsequent discussion. After wearing them to a game, he signed and auctioned them off on eBay. The shoes sold for $58,100 after 113 bids, with the money being donated for STEM education initiatives.[394][395]\n",

The film and TV deal included electronics, gaming and virtual reality and is focused on faith and family-friendly content.[398] In October 2018, Curry signed on as executive producer of the film Breakthrough, scheduled for release in April 2019.[399] Curry was also executive producer of the film Emanuel, scheduled for US theatrical release in select theaters on June 17, 2019.[400] The film focused on the responses by family members of victims of the 2015 Charleston church shooting. Curry remarked, \"In the face of adversity, in the face of tragedy, how can I get through it?\"[400]\n",
      "Beginning in 2019, Curry became both the executive producer and resident golf pro on the American sports reality competition television series Holey Moley.[401] On June 24, 2020, Curry released a trailer for his new show on his YouTube channel called Ultimate Home Championships, a show featuring people such as DeAndre Jordan, Ronda Rousey, and Kristopher London, where contestants competed in wacky at-home challenges using things in their home. In 2020, Unanimous Media signed a deal with Amazon's Audible.[402] The same year, Curry served as the executive producer of an animated revival of the 1970s sitcom Good Times along with the series' original executive producer, Norman Lear, and Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane. The series was green-lit by Netflix in 2020.[403] In 2021, Curry signed on as executive producer of The Queen of Basketball, a documentary short film about basketball legend Lusia Harris.
